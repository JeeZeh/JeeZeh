## Jesse Ashmore

Hi!

I'm a software engineer with Amazon (Dublin) working on high-volume data lake and graph technologies in AWS, powering service resiliency and HVE readiness for the Amazon Retail website.

This GitHub is a leaky abstraction of my (mostly healthy) obsessions with tech, music, languages and all things creative. If you want to talk about my work, or my side-projects, please reach out over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JeeZeh) or [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@jesse_ashmore).

### Favourite Projects

I love all projects equally (even the trash ones), but these are my favourite:
- [React Rail](https://github.com/JeeZeh/react-irish-rail) (www.reactrail.com)
  - A self-hosted React frontend (with PWA support) for the Irish Rail timetable API
- [YouTube Playlist Autosub Explorer](https://github.com/JeeZeh/youtube-playlist-autosub-explorer)
  - Pulls and indexes entire YouTube playlist transcripts for rapid fuzzy searching
- [Advent of Code](https://github.com/JeeZeh/advent-of-code)
  - All of my solutions for Advent of Code problems (Python, Rust, Java, TypeScript, etc.)
- [Winston](https://github.com/JeeZeh/winston)
  - A Word Document generator for AWS Transcribe outputting readable, color-coded, per-speaker transcripts
- [Jesse Bot](https://github.com/JeeZeh/jesse-bot)
  - Personal Discord bot written in Python with Discord.py (not entirely ready for public re-use but still happy to open-source it)
